# Encoder-Decoder

This project is a simple graphical application that allows users to encode or decode strings based on a custom algorithm. The application is built using Python's `tkinter` library for the GUI and `re` for regular expressions.

## Features

- Encode and decode text strings.
- Copy the result and key to the clipboard.
- Support for custom encoding and decoding logic.
- User-friendly GUI with help and instructions.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `tkinter` (usually comes pre-installed with Python)
- `re` module (standard Python library)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/encoder-decoder.git
    cd encoder-decoder
    ```

2. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3. Run the application:
    ```bash
    python main.py

4. Choose the processing mode ("Encode" or "Decode") by clicking the corresponding button.

5. Choose the reading mode ("Number" or "String") by clicking the corresponding button.

6. Click the "start encoding" or "start decoding" button to process the string.
