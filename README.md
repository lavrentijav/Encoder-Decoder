# Encoder-Decoder
Project for Encode or Decode number for safety

## What does this project do?

The Encode/Decode project is a tool for encoding and decoding numbers using multiple translations into various calculus systems. This tool allows the user to convert numbers from one calculus system to another by sequentially recoding them using several basic calculus systems.

## How is this project useful?

This project is useful for those who are interested in mathematics, programming, or just want to deepen their knowledge of mathematical analysis systems. It helps users understand the principles of translating numbers between different mathematical analysis systems, and also provides an opportunity to practice in this area.

## Where should I start?

1. Download the repository with the "Encode/Decode" project.
2. Run the script using the python compiler on your device.
3. Enter the number you want to recode, and enter the bases through "#" where all bases except the last one should not be greater than 10 bases.
4. Enter mod work: "c" for encode or "d" for decode
5. Get the results of the number conversion using various calculus systems.

## Where can I get additional help if I need it?

If you have any questions or need additional help when using the Encode/Decode project, please review the documentation in the project repository or ask your question in the "Problems" section on GitHub. Our team will be happy to help you figure out and solve any problems that arise."
